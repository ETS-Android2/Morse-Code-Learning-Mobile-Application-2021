# Morse-Code-Mobile-Application
Morse code is an old method for encoding letters used for communication. Morse code is still used and has various usages in our current age. However, the methods used for teaching Morse code are outdated and rely on traditional learning techniques. These techniques do not make use of modern technology or adapt to the latest learning techniques, Hence the need to modernize the way Morse code is taught and make use of the newly available technology. There are two main methods, which was used to gather the data for this project, the first method is the questionnaire, which was conducted by Google forms and distributed to people from different educational backgrounds, and the second method is document analysis, which was conducted by reviewing five different academic papers. This project introduces a modern and more practical approach for learning Morse code, by making use of the deep learning method and computer vision for real-time detection of Morse code flashlight signals, and by developing an application that applies learning techniques such as gamification, haptic learning, and collaborative learning, on a smartphone system. In conclusion, the solution enhances Morse code learning and provides a practice tool for its users on a popular platform, which can be easily set up to accept Morse code input from people with limited motor skills.
