## Description

Morse code, which was created by Samuel Morse in the early 1830s, are literal codes used to send messages by a sequence of pulses of two types: long pulse and short pulse. These impulses compose of lights or some other media [1].

Morse code is an old method for encoding letters used for communication. Morse code is still used and has various usages in our current age. However, the methods used for teaching Morse code are outdated and rely on traditional learning techniques. These techniques do not make use of modern technology or adapt to the latest learning techniques, Hence the need to modernize the way Morse code is taught and make use of the newly available technology.

This project introduces a modern and more practical approach for learning Morse code, by making use of the deep learning method and computer vision for real-time detection of Morse code flashlight signals, and by developing an application that applies learning techniques such as gamification, haptic learning, and collaborative learning, on a smartphone system.

This application is divided into two main modes: Single-User Mode and Multi-User Mode. In Single-User and Multi-User mode, they have two parts: training and exam. The Single-User mode is for one user, and the Multi-User mode allows one or more users to receive messages from a sender through Computer Vision. 

The abovementioned points should be implemented using Java for android smartphones.

Because of some circumstances in the last semester (2021 AT), a few functionalities have not been completed yet...
